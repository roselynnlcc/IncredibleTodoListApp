- RAM: 8 GB or more
- Operating System: Windows 10 or newer

 System being used are under the follow specifications:
- CPU: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1270P 2.20 GHz
- RAM: 32.0 GB
- Windows version: Windows 11 Pro 22H2

## Installation instructions
- Node.js: 
Download the Node.js installer from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
Follow the installation instructions. Ensure Node.js is installed by running “node” in the Command Prompt. A prompt of "Welcome to Node.js" is expected to appear.

- Android Studio: 
Download and install Android Studio from the official website: https://developer.android.com/studio


Install the following required components for the SDK Components Setup: 
- Android SDK
- Android API 34 (under Android SDK platform)
- Performance (Inter HAXM)
- Performance (Android Emulator hypervisor driver)
- Android Virtual Device

## Configuration Steps:

- Environment Variables: 
Environment variables are required to be set. Set ANDROID_HOME to the Android SDK path by visiting "Control Panel" -> "System and Security" -> "System" -> "Advanced system settings" -> "Environment Variables."

- React Native CLI: 
Install the React Native CLI globally by running “npm install -g react-native-cli” in the Command Prompt.

## Project creation:
- Create a New Project: 
To create a new React Native project, open command prompt, and run “npx react-native init ProjectName”. Replace " ProjectName " with your desired app name. This will set up a new React Native project with all the necessary files and dependencies.

## Running the project: 

- Android Device Simulator: 
To run the project in an Android simulator, open command prompt in our project folder and "run npx start”, which launches the Metro Bundler. Input "r" to reload the app. 

## Troubleshooting:
For troubleshooting on the set up, please refer to the following  [Troubleshooting guidelines](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#troubleshooting) from the official site.
